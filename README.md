# vsmod-Compass

This mod adds three craftable compasses to the game:

## Magnetic Compass

Crafted using 1 (fired) clay bowl, 1 magnetite nugget, and 1 stick. It always points north.

Alternate recipe: use 1 metal scrap instead of magnetite.

## Relative Compass

Crafted using 1 Magnetic Compass and 2 Temporal Gears. It remembers where it was crafted and always points to that spot.

## Origin Compass

Crafted using 1 Relative Compass and 2 Temporal Gears. That means it'll cost 4 gears total. It always points to the world's default spawn. If the default spawn has a radius, it points to the center of it. This will be the same spot for all players on the server.

## Known Issues

Compasses don't point in the correct direction when dropped on the ground, or probably also viewed in another player's hand.
